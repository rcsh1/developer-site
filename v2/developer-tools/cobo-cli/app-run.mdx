Use the `run` command to run a WaaS application locally.

## Usage
```shell
cobo app run [options]
```

## Options
- `-p`, `--port <INTEGER>`: Port on which the application will listen for incoming requests. If you do not use this option, the application will run on the default port `5000`.
- `-i`, `--iframe`: Load the application via iframe.

## Example

```shell
`cobo app run --port 8080`
```

This command starts the WaaS application and listens for incoming requests on port 8080.
