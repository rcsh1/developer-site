Cobo CLI supports GraphQL query that allows you to execute complex queries and retrieve specific data by using the Cobo GraphQL API.

For more details about GraphQL, please refer to the [Cobo GraphQL API documentation](/v2/developer-tools/graphql/overview).

- Always validate your queries before executing them in a production environment to avoid potential issues.
- Escape special characters in your query.

<Note>To make API requests, you need to authenticate your requests by logging in and setting up your API keys.</Note>

## Usage

```shell
cobo graphql -q <query>   # Use inline query
cobo graphql -f <file> # Load query from file
```

## Options

- `-q, --query`: The GraphQL query to execute. Can be a raw query string or a JSON string with a query key.
- `-f, --file`: Execute a query defined in a local file. The file must be a JSON file containing a query field.

## Example

### Run a query directly

```shell
cobo graphql -q 'query MyQuery {
  transactionPaginated(params: {currentPage: 1, pageSize: 10}) {
    data {
      assets {
        code
        description
        displayCode
      }
      assetId
    }
  }
}'
```

This query retrieves the first 10 transactions, including their asset IDs and associated asset details such as code, description, and display code.

### Run a query from a local file

```shell
cobo graphql -f query.json
```

Contents of `query.json` can be as follows:

```json
{
  "query": "query MyQuery { transactionPaginated(params: {currentPage: 1, pageSize: 10}) { data { assets { code description displayCode } assetId } } }"
}
```

This command executes the same query as the above example, but the query is defined in a JSON file.
