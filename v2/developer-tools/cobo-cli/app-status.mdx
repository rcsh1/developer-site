If you publish or update your Cobo Portal Apps in the production environment, a workflow is automatically triggered that requires approval from Cobo. Once approved, your app will be available to all users on Cobo Portal. You can use the `status` command to check the status of Cobo Portal Apps. 

Ensure that you run the command from the project directory where the manifest file is located.

## Usage
```shell
cobo app status
```

## Example
```shell
cobo app status
```

This command displays the App ID and current status of the Cobo Portal App.
