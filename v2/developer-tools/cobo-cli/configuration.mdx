This guide introduces how to inspect and modify the configurations of Cobo CLI. The configurations are used by various Cobo CLI commands, including `cobo env`, `cobo auth`, and `cobo keys`.

By default, Cobo CLI stores its configurations in your home directory (`~/.cobo/config.toml`). You can override this location by using the `--config-file <path>` option. For more information about this option, see [Global options](/v2/developer-tools/cobo-cli/global-options#custom-configuration-file-config-file).

## Configuration commands

### Set configuration values

To set a configuration value, use the following command:

```shell
cobo config set <key> <value>
```

### Retrieve configuration values

To retrieve a configuration value, use the following command:

```shell
cobo config get <key>
```

If the configuration key exists, it will display the value. Otherwise, it will inform you that the configuration was not found.

### List all configurations

To see all your current configuration settings, use the `list` subcommand:

```shell
cobo config list
```

This will display all key-value pairs in your configuration.

### Delete configuration Values

To remove a configuration value, use the `delete` subcommand:

```shell
cobo config delete <key>
```

## Important configurations

While you can store any custom configuration values, there are some key settings that Cobo CLI uses:

### Environment

You can set the environment using the `cobo config set environment <environment>` command:

```shell
cobo config set environment dev
```

Cobo CLI supports two environments:
- `dev`: For development purposes
- `prod`: For production use


<Note>
This command has the same effect as running `cobo env dev`.
</Note>

### Authentication method

You can set the authentication method using the `cobo config set auth_method <method>` command:

```shell
cobo config set auth_method apikey
```

Cobo CLI supports three authentication methods:
- `apikey`: Authenticate with an API key.
- `user`: Authenticate with your Cobo Portal account.
- `org`: Authenticate with an Org Access Token.


<Note>
This command has the same effect as running `cobo auth apikey`.
