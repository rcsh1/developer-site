<WaasSkillReminder />

Use the `delete` command to perform DELETE HTTP requests to a specified endpoint of the WaaS 2.0 service. 

If the `path` argument is provided, the command initiates a DELETE request to that endpoint. Otherwise, it retrieves a list of all available DELETE operations or displays the description of a specified operation within the WaaS 2.0 API.

<Note>To make API requests via Cobo CLI, you need to authenticate your requests by logging in and using Org Access Tokens or API Keys as the authentication method. For more information, refer to [Authenticate with Org Access Tokens](/v2/developer-tools/cobo-cli/login-and-authentication#authenticate-with-org-access-tokens) and [Authenticate with API Keys](/v2/developer-tools/cobo-cli/login-and-authentication#authenticate-with-api-keys).</Note>

<Note>Currently there is no DELETE operation within the WaaS 2.0 API.</Note>
