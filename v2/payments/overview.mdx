**Payment collection**

You can complete payment collection operations by calling [Payment API](/v2/payments/api-reference) or using [Checkout SDK](/v2/payments/checkout-sdk). If you are an institution such as a PSP or e-commerce platform that needs to serve downstream merchants, you can charge handling fees to merchants by specifying developer fees.

- In top-up mode, Cobo generates a dedicated top-up address for each user, and users can top up any amount to that address at any time. For details, see [Get top-up addresses](/v2/payments/get-topup-addresses).
- In order mode, Cobo creates a payment order with a specified amount and expiration date, and users need to complete payment within the specified time. For details, see [Create orders](/v2/payments/create-orders).

**Fund processing**

- **Sweeping**: When you initiate settlement, Cobo will sweep funds scattered across various receiving addresses to a unified sweep address for convenient centralized management and usage.
- **AML/KYT screening**: According to the wallet type you choose, Cobo provides different compliance screening solutions:
  - Custodial Wallets: Mandatory use of Cobo KYT for fund compliance screening to ensure secure and compliant transactions
  - MPC Wallets: You can flexibly choose to use Cobo KYT or [Screening App](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/apps/screening/introduction) for compliance screening to meet different compliance needs
- **Exception handling and refunds**: When encountering abnormal situations such as overpayment or underpayment, you can initiate refunds to customers or adopt other processing methods.
- **Exchange and cross-chain**: You can use [Token Swap App](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/apps/token-swap/introduction) to exchange one cryptocurrency for another or transfer to different blockchains.
- **Investment/DeFi**: If you want to invest a portion of idle funds to generate returns, you can use Cobo's [Earn App](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/apps/earn/introduction) to purchase stable investment products. You can also invest idle funds in different DeFi protocols.

**Settlement**

You can flexibly manage fund settlement through Payment API or Payment Management App. For each settlement, you can choose any of the following methods:
  - **Crypto withdrawal**: Directly transfer cryptocurrency to specified external wallet addresses for quick fund extraction
  - **Fiat off-ramp**: Convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency through OTC channels and transfer to specified bank accounts

Funds from top-up mode and order mode will be settled separately. During settlement, you need to specify the fund source for settlement, and you can choose to settle merchant balance or developer balance.
