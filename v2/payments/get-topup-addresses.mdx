You can call Payment API to get dedicated top-up addresses for users. The diagram below shows the interaction flow between users, merchants, developers, and Cobo:

    User ->> Merchant: Request to enable wallet/top-up function
    Merchant ->> Developer: Request to enable wallet
    Developer ->> Cobo: ① Get top-up address for this user
    Cobo ->> Developer: Return top-up address
    Cobo ->> Cobo: Address deposit polling
    Developer ->> Merchant: Return top-up address
    Merchant ->> User: Display top-up address
    User ->> Cobo: Transfer funds to address for top-up
    Cobo ->> Cobo: Compliance check
    Cobo ->> Developer: ② Push webhook events, notify successful top-up
    Developer ->> Merchant: Sync top-up status
    Merchant ->> User: Update wallet balance
```

## Prerequisites

You have completed all steps mentioned in [Preparation](/v2/payments/preparation).

## Get top-up addresses

1. Call [Get top-up address](/v2/api-references/payment/get-top-up-address) to create a top-up address for a specified user of a specified merchant. Key parameters in the request include:
   * **Merchant ID** (`merchant_id`): The unique identifier of the merchant in the Cobo system, assigned by Cobo when you register the merchant.
   * **Custom user ID** (`custom_payer_id`): The unique identifier of the user in your system.
   * **Token ID** (`token_id`): Specifies the cryptocurrency and blockchain network that the top-up address needs to support.

2. **Configure top-up event listening**: Receive top-up related event notifications through webhooks, including:
   - `payment.transaction.created`: New deposit transaction detected at the receiving address
   - `payment.transaction.held`: Deposit transaction failed compliance screening
- `payment.transaction.complete`: In top-up mode, deposit transaction passed compliance screening, funds successfully credited and included in actual received amount.

## Call example

The following is sample code for calling [Get top-up address](/v2/api-references/payment/get-top-up-address) to get a top-up address:
