This document introduces the core features of the Cobo payments solution.

## Pay-ins

- Provides flexible and diverse pay-in types, supporting various scenarios such as fixed/unfixed amounts, timed/untimed payments, and one-time/recurring deductions:
  - **Top-up mode**: Cobo generates a dedicated top-up address for each payer, and payers can top up any amount to that address at any time. For details, see [Payment collection in top-up mode](/v2/payments/get-topup-addresses).
  - **Order mode**: Cobo creates payment orders with a specified amount and validity period, and payers need to complete payment within the specified time. Supports order cancellation, refunds, and handling abnormal situations such as overpayment, underpayment, and late payment. For details, see [Payment collection in order mode](/v2/payments/create-orders).
  - **Subscription mode**: Periodic, automatic deductions through smart contracts and other methods. For details, see [Payment collection in subscription mode](/v2/payments/create-subscriptions).
- Chain and token support: Supports two mainstream stablecoins, USDC and USDT, which can be used on multiple mainstream chains. For details, see [Supported tokens and chains](/v2/payments/supported-chains-and-tokens).

## Fund management
- AML/KYT screening: According to the wallet type you select, Cobo provides different compliance screening solutions:
  - Custodial Wallets: Mandatory use of Cobo KYT for fund compliance screening to ensure transaction security and compliance
  - MPC Wallets: You can flexibly choose to use Cobo KYT or [Screening App](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/apps/screening/introduction) for compliance screening to meet different compliance needs
- Exchange and cross-chain: You can use [Token Swap App](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/apps/token-swap/introduction) to exchange one cryptocurrency for another or transfer it to a different chain.
