Cobo's Checkout SDK provides ready-to-use payment collection frontend components. Through simple iframe integration, you can quickly develop a secure and reliable cryptocurrency payment collection page without directly calling the payment collection interfaces in [Payment API](/v2/api-references/payment) or handling complex UI design and payment logic, significantly reducing development costs and time investment.

## Sample project
Cobo provides a [sample project](https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobo-checkout-sdk-demo) that demonstrates the basic integration process of the SDK. The sample project contains minimal implementation of parameter passing and authentication, and you can add your own business logic based on this sample code.

## Product features

Checkout SDK interface display (mobile example):

**User experience**

- **Full device adaptation**: Native support for mobile, desktop, and tablet devices with built-in Chinese and English language switching.
- **Multi-chain multi-currency support**: Covers mainstream stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, supporting mainstream blockchains like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana, BSC, and Polygon.
- **One-click payment**: Supports QR code payment and one-click address copying with real-time exchange rate display.
- **Complete transaction monitoring**: Provides complete on-chain data tracking including transaction hash, address information, and block confirmation count.
- **Smart error handling**: Covers abnormal situations such as payment failure, order expiration, and insufficient amounts, providing clear solutions.

**Technical features**

- **Security isolation**: Embedded in your page through iframe with independent domain, ensuring security and stability of the payment environment.
- **Bidirectional communication**: Based on postMessage mechanism for real-time, reliable bidirectional data transmission between iframe and parent page.
- **Continuous maintenance**: Iframe is maintained and updated by the Cobo team, so you don't need to worry about underlying interface changes. You only need to adjust integration code when interface parameters have major changes (such as adding or removing parameters).

## Prerequisites

1. Contact Cobo through [support@cobo.com](mailto:support@cobo.com) to add your organization to the Checkout SDK usage whitelist.

2. Complete all steps mentioned in [Preparation](/v2/payments/preparation). During the preparation process, please ensure you have:

   - Obtained API Key and API Secret
   - Completed merchant registration and obtained merchant ID
   - Configured webhook endpoint for receiving payment status notifications

   Please properly save the above API Key, merchant ID, and other key information, which will be used in the subsequent SDK integration process.

## Integration steps

### Get Access Token

You need to complete SDK OAuth authentication through Access Token. The authentication process is as follows:

1. Your application server calls [Get Access Token](/v2/api-references/oauth/get-access-token) to obtain Access Token and Refresh Token.
2. Application frontend gets Access Token from backend and passes it to iframe to complete authentication.
3. Access Token is valid for 1 hour. Before Access Token expires, the server needs to call [Refresh Access Token](/v2/api-references/oauth/refresh-access-token) and pass in the Refresh Token obtained in the above steps to get new Access Token and Refresh Token. If Token expires, iframe will send `TOKEN_EXPIRED` event to parent page.

The following code snippet demonstrates an example of obtaining Access Token and Refresh Token using [Python SDK](/v2/developer-tools/quickstart-python):

```py
from cobo_waas2 import Configuration, ApiClient, OAuthApi, ExchangePermissionTokenRequest, RefreshPermissionTokenRequest

configuration = Configuration.set_default(Configuration(
            api_private_key="<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>",
            host="https://api.dev.cobo.com/v2"
        ))
with ApiClient(configuration=configuration) as api_client:
    api_instance = OAuthApi(api_client=api_client)
    exchange_response = api_instance.exchange_permission_token(
        exchange_permission_token_request=ExchangePermissionTokenRequest(permission_type="payment_orders_payin"))

    response = api_instance.refresh_permission_token(
        refresh_permission_token_request=RefreshPermissionTokenRequest(refresh_token=exchange_response.refresh_token))
```

### Integrate iframe

The following steps are explained using the [sample project](https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobo-checkout-sdk-demo) as an example. You can refer to this sample project and integrate according to your own business logic.

1. Create iframe container. When the page loads, the browser will fetch and display the payment collection interface from the specified URL.
<Note>You need to allow iframe access to clipboard through `allow="clipboard-write"` to support one-click copy function for receiving addresses.</Note>

```html
<iframe
  ref="checkoutIframe"
  :src="iframeUrl"
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="clipboard-write"
></iframe>
```

Configure iframe source URL:

```ts
// Development environment
const iframeUrl = 'https://payout-checkout.dev.cobo.com';
// Production environment
// const iframeUrl = 'https://payout-checkout.cobo.com';
```

2. Initialize iframe in `src/views/CheckoutDemo.vue` and pass in merchant ID, amount, currency and other order information. For specific field explanations, refer to [Create Pay-in Order](/v2/api-references/payment/create-pay-in-order) interface documentation.

```ts
// Initialize iFrame
const initializeCheckout = async () => {
  showIframe.value = true
  currentOrder.value = null
  // Wait for DOM update before initializing iFrame
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100))
  if (checkoutIframe.value) {
    checkoutIframeManager.initialize(checkoutIframe.value, {
      fiatCurrency: 'USD', // The fiat currency of the order. Currently, only USD is supported.
      fiatAmount: amount.value, // The base amount of the order in fiat currency
      merchantId, // The merchant ID
      merchantName, // The merchant name
      merchantLogo, // The merchant logo
      merchantUrl, // The merchant website URL
      feeAmount: '0.01', // The developer fee for the order in fiat currency
      merchantOrderCode: merchantOrderCode.value, // A unique reference code assigned by the merchant to identify this order in their system.
      pspOrderCode: pspOrderCode.value, // A unique reference code assigned by you (the developer) to identify this order in your system.
      expiredIn: 30 * 60, // The expiration time of the pay-in order, represented as a UNIX timestamp in seconds.
      locale: locale.value,
      supportToken: ['USDT', 'USDC'],
      supportChain: ['ARBITRUM_ETH', 'BASE_ETH', 'BSC_BNB', 'ETH', 'MATIC', 'SOL', 'TRON'],
    })
    addEventLog('INFO', 'Checkout initialized')
  }
```

3. Implement bidirectional communication between your page and iframe in `src/services/checkoutIframeService.ts`. You need to listen to events from iframe in your page and handle them according to event types.

```ts
public initialize(iframeElement: HTMLIFrameElement, config: Partial<ICheckoutInfo>): void {
  this.iframe = iframeElement
  this.config = config
  this.messageCount = 0
  window.addEventListener('message', this.messageHandler as EventListener)
  this.iframe.onload = () => {
    this.iframeLoaded = true
  }
}
```

4. After iframe completes initialization, it will send `LOADED` event to your page.

```ts
private handleIframeMessage(event: MessageEvent): void {
  const message = event.data as CheckoutIframeInboundMessage

  switch (message.type) {
    case CheckoutInboundMessageType.LOADED:
      this.sendCheckoutInfo()
      this.sendAccessToken()
      break
  }
}
```

After your page receives the `LOADED` event, you need to call the backend service to get the Access Token, then send the `GET_TOKEN` event to the iframe, and pass the Access Token as data to the iframe. At this point, the iframe initialization process is complete.

```ts
  public async sendAccessToken(): Promise<void> {
    try {
      // Get the Access Token
      const accessToken = await getAccessToken()

      // Send INIT message
      const message: CheckoutIframeOutboundMessage = {
        type: CheckoutOutboundMessageType.GET_TOKEN,
        payload: {
          accessInfo: {
            accessToken: accessToken.access_token,
            refreshToken: accessToken.refresh_token || '',
            tokenType: accessToken.token_type,
            expiresIn: accessToken.expires_in,
          },
        },
      }

      this.iframe.contentWindow?.postMessage(message, '*')
      this.messageCount++
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to send configuration to iframe:', error)
    }
  }
```

### Order status monitoring

After users create an order on the payment collection page, Cobo will use polling to detect all transactions deposited to the receiving address.

   * You can subscribe to webhook events to get real-time update notifications of order status and transaction status. Please refer to [Webhook reference](/v2/payments/status-and-events) to understand the trigger time and returned data structure of each event.
   * You can also query individual payment order status by calling [Get pay-in order information](/v2/api-references/payment/get-pay-in-order-information), or query all order statuses by calling [List all pay-in orders](/v2/api-references/payment/list-all-pay-in-orders).

## Fund settlement

After payment collection is completed, you can flexibly manage fund settlement through the Payment API or Payment Management App. For each settlement, you can choose either of the following methods:

- Cryptocurrency withdrawal: Directly transfer cryptocurrency to a specified external wallet address for fast fund extraction
- Fiat currency withdrawal: Convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency through OTC channels and transfer to a specified bank account

Funds from deposit mode and order mode will be settled separately. During settlement, you need to specify the source of settlement funds, and you can choose to settle merchant balance or developer balance.

- [Order mode settlement process](/v2/payments/settle-orders)
- [Amount definitions and balance calculation explanation](/v2/payments/amounts-and-balances)
