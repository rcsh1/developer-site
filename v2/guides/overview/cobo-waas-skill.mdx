As a developer, you can use Cobo WaaS Skill with Claude Code, Cursor, or other familiar AI coding assistants to interact with the [Cobo WaaS 2.0 API](/v2/guides/overview/introduction) via natural language, or to generate SDK invocation code for your applications.


### Key Features

Cobo WaaS Skill is a set of commands, reference documents, code examples, and best practices that enable:

- **Performing WaaS operations via command line** – Use simple CLI commands to perform any WaaS API-supported operation, including wallet management, transaction flows, and address management.
- **Intelligent SDK code generation** – Describe your business logic in natural language and the Skill will generate production-ready code for Python, Node.js, Go, or Java SDKs.
- **Developer-friendly utilities** – Generate API keys, test webhook events, and execute GraphQL queries through CLI commands.


## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Claude Code or Cursor installed
- Cobo Portal account

### Installation

Install the Cobo CLI and the WaaS Skill:

```bash
# Install Cobo CLI
pip install cobo-cli

# Install Skill for Claude Code
cobo skill install claude

# Or for Cursor
cobo skill install cursor

# Install Skill for all supported AI assistants in the current project directory
cobo skill install all --scope local

# Verify installation
cobo skill status
```

<Note>If you have already installed Cobo CLI, you must upgrade to version **0.1.1** or above to use the Cobo WaaS Skill. Run `pip install --upgrade cobo-cli` to upgrade.</Note>

### Starting your first WaaS operation

Once installed, you can use natural language in your AI assistant to perform WaaS operations. Here's an example of setting up and making your first API call:

<Tip>For best results, explicitly mention the skill by prefixing your prompt with `/cobo-waas` or including "Use Cobo WaaS skill" in your request.</Tip>

**What you ask your AI assistant:**
```
"/cobo-waas set up the dev environment and list my wallets"
```

Or:
```
"Use Cobo WaaS skill to set up the dev environment and list my wallets"
```

**What the AI assistant does:**
```bash
# Set environment to dev
cobo env dev

# Generate API key pair
cobo keys generate --key-type API
# Output: API Key (Public): abc123...
#         API Secret (Private): def456...

# You need to register the public key in the Cobo Portal developer console
# See details at https://manuals.cobo.com/cn/portal/developer-console/create-api-key

# Configure authentication
cobo auth apikey

# Test API connectivity
cobo get /wallets --limit 10
```

### Example commands

Here are examples of natural language requests you can make:

**For CLI Operations:**
- **"Create an Asset Wallet named 'Treasury' and generate an Ethereum address"**
- **"Execute a transfer of 0.01 ETH from wallet f47ac10b-... to address 0x1234..."**
- **"Trigger a test webhook event for transaction success"**


**For Vibe Coding (SDK Generation):**
 
- **"Generate Python code to create a wallet and poll for transaction completion"**
- **"Write Node.js code for a webhook handler that processes transaction events"**
- **"Generate Python code for an Exchange app that creates deposit addresses for each user"**

The AI assistant will execute the appropriate CLI commands, handle errors, and provide structured feedback at each step. For SDK generation requests, it produces production-ready code in your chosen language.

## Example project

The video below showcases a web wallet application that was built from the ground up using the Cobo WaaS Skill:

  <source src="/v2/images/guides/skill-demo.mp4#t=0.1" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Key prompt examples include:

- "Help me build an app where users can create wallets and generate addresses on blockchain networks like BTC, ETH, or TRON"
- "Update the frontend to include wallet type selection"
- "For each wallet, get the balance and display it accordingly"
- "Allow users to transfer tokens out of a selected wallet"
