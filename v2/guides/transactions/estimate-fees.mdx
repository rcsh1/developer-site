Transaction fees are essential for processing and validating transactions on a blockchain network. They ensure network security, incentivize validators, and maintain efficiency. The method of calculating these fees depends on the blockchain's design and current network conditions. Cobo offers specific features to streamline transaction fee estimation for users.
- When you make a transfer on Cobo Portal, you can see the estimated transaction fee on the UI. 
- You can call the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) API operation. 

<Note>The estimated transaction fee reflects current network conditions and may change by the time the actual transaction is processed.</Note>

When you call the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) operation, you need to specify the following parameters:
- `request_type`: The type of transaction, which can be a transfer or a contract call.
- `source`: The transaction source.
- `destination`: The transaction destination.
- (Only required for transfers) `token_id`: The ID of the token being transferred.
- (Only required for contract calls) `chain_id`: The ID of the chain on which the smart contract is deployed.

You will get the estimated transaction fee with different fee levels in the response, which varies based on the blockchain network and the fee model used.


## Fee models

Each blockchain may employ various fee models to calculate transaction fees, creating a one-to-many relationship with its fee structures. For example, Ethereum supports both the Legacy model and the EIP-1559 model.

Cobo currently supports transactions with the following fee models:

| Fee Model | Calculation Method | Typical Blockchains Using This Model | Customizable Parameters | 
|-----------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Legacy    | Transaction fee = gas price * gas units used<ul><li>Gas price: The gas price, in wei, represents the amount of ETH that must be paid to validators for processing transactions per gas unit used.</li><li>Gas units: A measure of computational work required to perform operations on the Ethereum network.</li></ul>   | Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains | <ul><li>Gas price</li><li>Gas limit</li></ul>Refer to the response of the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) operation for details. |
| [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) | Transaction fee = (base fee per gas unit + priority fee per gas unit) * gas units used<ul><li>Base fee per gas unit: The base fee required to include a transaction in a block per gas unit used on the chain, dynamically adjusted based on network demand.</li><li>Priority fee per gas unit: An additional fee paid to miners to prioritize the transaction per gas unit used on the chain, also known as a tip.</li><li>Gas units: A measure of computational work required to perform operations on the Ethereum network.</li></ul> | Currently supported chains are Ethereum Mainnet, Sepolia Testnet, Scroll Mainnet, Base, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Sonic, and Berachain.  | <ul><li>Maximum gas fee per gas unit</li><li>Maximum priority fee per gas unit</li><li>Gas limit</li></ul>Refer to the response of the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) operation for details. |
| UTXO      | Transaction fee = fee rate * transaction size<ul><li>Fee rate: The fee rate, in sat/vByte, represents the satoshis you are willing to pay for each byte of data that your transaction will consume on the blockchain.</li><li>Transaction size: The total size of a transaction in bytes, affecting the total fee in UTXO models.</li></ul> | Bitcoin and other UTXO-based chains | <ul><li>Max fee amount</li><li>Fee Rate</li></ul>Refer to the response of the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) operation for details. |
| Fixed     | The transaction fee is fixed fee amount. | TRON | Maximum fee amount. Refer to the response of the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) operation for details. |
| [Solana](https://solana.com/docs/core/fees) | Transaction fee = base fee + compute unit limit * compute unit price<ul><li>Base fee: A fixed fee charged per signature (default 5,000 lamports per signature).</li><li>Compute unit limit: The maximum number of compute units your transaction is allowed to consume.</li><li>Compute unit price: The price paid per compute unit, set in lamports, used to increase transaction priority.</li><li>Rent (if applicable): Charged periodically for non–rent-exempt accounts. This is not part of the transaction fee, but may apply if the account balance is below the exemption threshold.</li></ul> | Solana | <ul><li>Compute unit limit</li><li>Compute unit price</li></ul>Refer to the response of the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) operation for details. |
| [Filecoin](https://spec.filecoin.io/systems/filecoin_vm/gas_fee/#section-systems.filecoin_vm.gas_fee.summary) | Transaction fee = min(gas fee cap, base fee + gas premium) * gas limit<Note>On-chain actual fee is calculated as: <code>base fee * gas used + gas premium * gas limit</code>.</Note><ul><li>Gas fee cap: The maximum gas price you are willing to pay per unit.</li><li>Base fee: The minimum fee required for inclusion in a block. It is dynamically adjusted based on network congestion and is burned to reduce total FIL supply.</li><li>Gas premium: A user-defined tip to incentivize miner prioritization.</li><li>Gas limit: The maximum amount of gas your transaction can consume.</li></ul> | Filecoin | <ul><li>Gas limit</li><li>Gas premium</li><li>Gas fee cap</li></ul>Refer to the response of the [Estimate transaction fee](/v2/api-references/transactions/estimate-transaction-fee) operation for details. |

<Note>Solana and Filecoin each support two fee models: their native model and the legacy model. When calling the transaction API operations, you can choose which model to use. However, for Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transactions, you must use the same fee model as the original transaction.</Note> 

While most transactions follow the blockchain's native fee model, transactions from Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets) and Exchange Wallets always use the fixed fee model. If you specify a different fee model when initiating a transaction from these wallets, the API request will return an error.

<Note>For both the Legacy and EIP-1559 fee models, an additional `reserved_fee` is charged for submitting transaction calldata to L1 (Layer 1).</Note>


## Fee levels

Transaction fees are influenced by speed levels. Users can choose between slow, recommended, and fast transaction speeds, with faster speeds incurring higher fees.

Cobo supports three fee levels for Legacy, EIP-1559, UTXO, Solana and Filecoin models:

- Slow: Lowest fee, longer confirmation time.
- Recommended: Balanced fee and confirmation time.
- Fast: Higher fee for quicker processing.

## Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transaction fee

Replace-By-Fee (RBF) is a feature that allows you to replace an unconfirmed transaction with a new version that typically pays a higher transaction fee. This functionality provides flexibility to modify transactions after they are broadcast but before they are confirmed by miners. For more details, refer to [Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transactions](/v2/guides/transactions/manage-transactions#replace-by-fee-rbf-transactions).

The logic for estimating RBF transaction fees is similar to that for normal transactions, with the addition of a fee increase for the RBF transaction. The key points to consider when estimating RBF transaction fees based on different fee models are as follows:
- Legacy: Increase the gas price. The gas price for an RBF transaction must be higher than that of the transaction being replaced.
- EIP-1559: Increase both the max fee per gas and max priority fee per gas.
- UTXO: Increase the fee rate and ensure that the product of the fee rate and transaction size is greater than that of the original transaction. If not, the node might reject broadcasting the transaction.
- Fixed: Increase the fee amount.
- Filecoin: It is recommended to increase both gas premium and gas fee cap by 25%.

## How Cobo estimate the fees

Below is how Cobo calculates the fees for each model:

| Fee Model | Estimation Method | 
|-----------|--------------------|
| Legacy    | <ul><li>Gas price: Calculated based on third-party nodes and self-managed nodes.</li><li>Gas limit: Queried from the corresponding node based on the source and destination.</li></ul>  | 
| [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)  | <ul><li>Maximum gas fee per gas unit: Calculated based on third-party nodes and self-managed nodes.</li><li>Maximum priority fee per gas unit: Calculated based on third-party nodes and self-managed nodes.</li><li>Gas limit: Queried from the corresponding node based on the source and destination.</li></ul>  | 
| UTXO      | <ul><li>Fee rate: Calculated based on third-party nodes and self-managed nodes.</li><li>Transaction size: Calculated based on the source spendables (UTXOs) and destination.</li></ul> | 
| Fixed     | <ul><li>Fixed fee amount: Calculated based on self-managed nodes.</li></ul>  |
