<Note>The WaaS 2.0 service will be publicly available by July 17. We appreciate your patience as we work to deliver the best possible experience.</Note>

Cobo Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) 2.0 API enables you to access Cobo's full suite of crypto wallet technologies with powerful and flexible access controls. The RESTful SaaS API over HTTPS provides a variety of capabilities, including managing wallets and addresses, making transactions, and configuring webhook endpoints.

## HTTP hosts
The WaaS service offers several HTTP hosts for different use cases: 

- Development environment: `https://api.dev.cobo.com`
- Production environment: `https://api.cobo.com`

## Authentication
To ensure secure access to your crypto assets via the WaaS 2.0 API, the WaaS service validates the use of EDDSA signatures for authentication in all API calls. Access to the API is denied without proper authentication. You need to provide an API key, a nonce, and an API signature in the request header.

## Query and path parameters
A path parameter is a variable segment embedded directly within the request URL. It allows you to specify a specific resource or data point within the API. For example, the `transactions` endpoint has a path parameter `transaction_id`. To retrieve information for a transaction with ID `a239861be9a4afe080c359b7fe4a1d`, you can use the request URL `https://api.dev.cobo.com/v2/transactions/a239861be9a4afe080c359b7fe4a1d`.

A query parameter is a key-value pair appended to the end of a request URL after a question mark. It allows you to filter the response of an API request. For example, the `supported_chains` endpoint supports a query parameter `wallet_type`. To filter the chains supported by Custodial Wallets, you can use the request URL `https://api.dev.cobo.com/v2/wallets/supported_chains?wallet_type=Custodial`.

## Sorting

Some API operations support the sort_by and direction parameters, which enable you to sort the result based on a specified field in ascending or descending order.

For example, if you want to sort the transactions by the status field in descending order, you can append the sorting parameters to the request URL as `https://api.dev.cobo.com/v2/transactions?sort_by=status&direction=DESC`.

## Pagination

Some endpoints support pagination which allows you to retrieve data in manageable chunks. You can control the page size and navigate through the dataset using three query parameters:

- `before`: This parameter specifies an object ID that acts as a starting point for retrieving data in reverse chronological order. 
- `after`: This parameter specifies an object ID that acts as a starting point for retrieving data in chronological order.

- `limit`: This parameter defines the maximum number of objects you want to receive in each response.

**Note**: If both `before` and `after` are provided, only the setting of `before` will take effect.

## Webhook events

To receive important event notifications, you can register a webhook endpoint and subscribe to the relevant events. When a subscribed event occurs, the WaaS service will send an HTTP POST request to the registered webhook endpoint, providing the event data in JSON format. To learn more about how to subscribe to webhook events, see [Register a webhook event](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/developer-console/webhooks-create).
