## Tools you can leverage

Cobo offers the following tools that allow you to develop a Cobo Portal App with ease.

### WaaS 2.0 API

The [WaaS 2.0 API](/v2/api-references/playground) is the latest version of Cobo's WaaS API offering. It enables a Cobo Portal App to interact with users' wallets, including:

- Querying information, such as wallet specifics, balances, and transaction history.
- Managing wallets, such as transferring tokens and calling smart contracts.

The API uses [Cobo OAuth](/v2/apps/authentication) to authorize a Cobo Portal App to access other organizations' data and perform operations on the organizations' wallets.

### Cobo CLI

Cobo CLI is a developer tool that allows you to build, test, and publish Cobo Portal Apps directly from the command line. With Cobo CLI, you can easily handle common tasks such as creating, publishing, and updating an app.

### Cobo UI toolkit

The Cobo UI toolkit is a library of pre-built components that adhere to Cobo Portal's design and visual standards. You can leverage the toolkit to quickly build a user interface for your Cobo Portal Apps.
